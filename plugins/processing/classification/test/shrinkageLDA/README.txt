Some (toy) materials to test the shrinkage LDA.

The data were created by createData.R

Running the example scenarios in Designer should illustrate how the shrinkage LDA behaves better in these situations where the data dimension exceeds the example amounts.

Todo: proper automatic tests, e.g. verify that accuracy in some real-data scenario stays above a threshold.
