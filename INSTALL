|Introduction|

This document explains how to build the platform from sources.

|Build.target|

OpenViBE should compile on x86 architecture running Microsoft Windows 2k/XP with
Visual C++ 2005 express edition.
OpenViBE should compile on x86 architecture running Linux with gcc 4.*

Please consider that trying to compile OpenViBE on another hardware/OS/compilator
is experimental and has not been tested. Several people reported some problems
on IA64 architectures because of some of its dependencies. If you want to try
and, contribute on getting OpenViBE run on other hardware/OS/compilators,
please do so but do not expect for support in the short time.

|Prerequesite.dependencies|

In order to build the software, you will have to install several dependencies.
For this to be done, you can use prebuilt installation scripts that will
automatically prepare the environment for you.
<win32-install_dependencies> does it for you under Windows and
<linux-install_dependencies> does it for you under Linux.

Windows installation processes prebuilt packages so it is quite fast. However,

Linux installation processes source packages and builds them from scratch,
supposing almost no pre-requisite dependencies (you should be able to install
every dependencies in a local directory without root access and without using
any package manager such as apt-get or yum). The build process takes quite a
long time, something like 2/3 hours on my computer.

|Preparing.environment|

The build process uses lots of environement variables. The script directory
contains the necessary files in order to build the whole platform / plugins.
However, the script initializing the environement variables is missing because
it should be tuned acording each local installation and usage. The
<linux-init_env_command-skeleton> and the <win32-init_env_command-skeleton>
can be used as a basis for those files however. For linux, most users will
want to copy the <linux-init_env_command-skeleton> to <linux-init_env_command>
so they get a correct file. For windows, copying the skeleton may not be
enough because of Visual Studio paths and so on... You will have to tweak ;)

|Building.the.platforme|

If you want to build all the projects at once, you can use the <linux-build>
script or the <win32-build>. Both script call the appropriate
<init_env_command> so they have correct values. However, each project will
have its build in its own directory. The <linux-collect_build> and
<win32-collect_build> will get all the built files in the <dist> directory
that will be usable...

<linux-test> and <win32-test> will collect the build and launch most
interesting softwares for you.

congratulations, you have OpenViBE working !
