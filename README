|Introduction|

*OpenViBE* is a software collection in order to process <EEG> (Electro
Encephalo Graphic) and <MEG> (Magneto Encephalo Graphic) signals in
neurofeedback or <BCI> (Brain Computer Interface) applications. More 
on the web page :

|Tree|

<openvibe>
	This folder contains the specifications of the *OpenViBE*
	platform. It mostly consists in a list of unimplemented
	classes. Those classes have to be implemented wether by the
	kernel or the plugin developpers

<openvibe-kernel-omk>
	This folder contains a kernel implentation based on <OpenMASK>
	more at the <OpenMASK> webpage *http://www.openmask.org*

<openvibe-modules>
	This folder contains specific helper modules (mainly for
	portability)

<openvibe-plugins>
	This folder contains the plugins of the *OpenViBE* platform.
	Those plugins will be separated using a directory per plugin
	module :

	<samples>
		This folder contains a minimal sample plugin module
		that shows how a box algorithm should be implemented,
		how a box behavior should be implemented and how
		the plugin module should declare its plugin objects
		to the kernel
	<acquisition>
		This folder contains signal acquisition tools
	<utility>
		This folder contains several usefull tools which have
		no direct relationship with EEG

<openvibe-toolkit>
	This folder contains some helper objects designed for plugin
	developpers.
