         *========================================*

|Introduction|

This should give you the basic knowledge of what *OpenViBE* is and
how the project files are organised and should be used.

|Folders|

<openvibe>
	This folder contains the specifications of the *OpenViBE*
	platform. It mostly consists in a list of unimplemented
	classes. Those classes have to be implemented wether by the
	kernel or the plugin developpers

<openvibe-kernelimpl>
	This folder contains kernel related implemented classes.

<openvibe-pluginsimpl>
	This folder contains the plugins of the *OpenViBE* platform.
	Those plugins will be separated using a directory per plugin
	module :

	<samples>
		This folder contains a minimal sample plugin module
		that shows how a box algorithm should be implemented,
		how a box behavior should be implemented and how
		the plugin module should declare its plugin objects
		to the kernel
