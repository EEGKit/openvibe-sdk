|Introduction|

OpenViBE is a software platform for the design, test and use of
Brain-Computer Interfaces. This document provides basic
information on what you just downloaded.

|Code.source.access|

The code source of the project can be accessed on the INRIA gForge :

https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/openvibe/ (welcome page)
https://gforge.inria.fr/mail/?group_id=276 (mailing lists)
http://www.irisa.fr/bunraku/OpenViBE/forum (forums)
https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?group_id=276 (bug tracker)

Getting most up to date (unstable) source code from the forge can
be done thanks to this command :

svn checkout svn+ssh://developername@scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/openvibe

|Repository.organisation|

The project repository is organised by software modules. Each software
module can have its own branches and tags and is compiled separately
from other software modules. The repository basically looks like this :

root of the repository
 + <openvibe> (API / specifications)
 + <openvibe-kernel> (kernel implementation)
 + <openvibe-toolkit> (developement help components)
 + <openvibe-applications> (several OpenViBE user applications)
    + <acquisition-server>
    + <designer>
    + ...
 + <openvibe-plugins> (several OpenViBE plugin collections)
    + <samples>
    + <acquisition>
    + ...
 + <openvibe-modules> (several abstraction and portability components)
    + <ebml>
    + <socket>
    + ...

Each software module has its own branching tree :

root of the module
 + <trunc> (current unstable version)
 + <tags> (tagged versions)
    + 0.0.1
    + ...
 + <branches> (work in progress, probably really unstable)
    + wip-developer1
    + wip-...

And finally in each branch, each software module have this UNIX-like tree :

+ <bin> (target folder for compiled binaries)
+ <doc> (target folder for compiled documentation)
+ <etc> (target folder for configuration files)
+ <include> (target folder for API headers)
+ <lib> (target folder for compiled libraries)
+ <share> (shared file folders for all the datas)
+ <src> (source code of the module)
   + <doc> (documentation files for the module)
+ <test> (unit test source code for the module)

|Support|
